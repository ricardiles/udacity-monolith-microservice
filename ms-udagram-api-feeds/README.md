# ms-udacity-api-feeds

This repository contains the microservices of the feeds in the principal application.  

* .travis.yml: configuration to deploy in Travis CI
* deployment.yaml: configuration to deploy in Kubernetes.

The service was generated by console because I needed expose the application in the Cluster.

```
kubectl expose deployment udagram-feeds-app --type=ClusterIP --name=udagram-feeds-app
```
