This repository contains the microservices of the frontend in the principal application.  

* .travis.yml: configuration to deploy in Travis CI
* deployment.yaml: configuration to deploy in Kubernetes.

The service was generated by console because I needed expose the application in the Internet to test without Cors problems and easly to test.


```
kubectl expose deployment udagram-frontend-app --type=ClusterIP --name=udagram-frontend-app
```
