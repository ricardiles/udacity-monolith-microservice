This repository contains the reverse proxy of the application.  

* .travis.yml: configuration to deploy in Travis CI
* deployment.yaml: configuration to deploy in Kubernetes.

The service was generated by console because I needed expose the application in the Internet to test without Cors problems and easly to test with the postman collection.

```
kubectl expose deployment reverseproxy --type=LoadBalancer --name=reverseproxy-svc service reverseproxy-svc exposed
```
