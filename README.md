# Ricardo Ardiles Udagram Image Filtering Application

## Getting Started

This repository contains excercises and project of Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program. The base code is in [nd9990-c3-microservices-exercises](https://github.com/udacity/nd9990-c3-microservices-exercises/tree/master/project)

## Current project

As we learned in class, this project refactor udagram monolith application into microservices.

I thought is was a great idea separate every microservice in his respectively repository to get isolated deploys. This is the best way to test every docker image creation in Travis CI.  

Anyway I put every microservice in a folder in this repository for your evaluation.
